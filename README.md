# HouseMovingAssistant

This is an app that was shown during Luce Carter's talk at .NET Conf: Focus on MAUI event.

If you wish to run this app yourself, make sure to update it with your own Realm-AppId. You can find this in the dashboard of your Atlas App Services application. If you haven't got one, you will need to make sure you have created a new App Services application (blank template) which will also create you a free-forever M0 tier Atlas Cluster (if you haven't already got one for the project you are creating this in). If you have already have an Atlas cluster you would like to use, you can.
